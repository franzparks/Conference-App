App Engine application for the Udacity Nanodegree: Full Stack Developer (Project 4)

## Products
- [App Engine][1]

## Language
- [Python][2]

## APIs
- [Google Cloud Endpoints][3]
- [API Explorer][7]

## Setup Instructions
1. Update the value of `application` in `app.yaml` to the app ID you
   have registered in the App Engine admin console.
1. Update the values in the `settings.py` to
   reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the
   [Developer Console][4].
1. Update the value of CLIENT_ID in `static/js/app.js` to the Web client ID

1. Run the app with the devserver using `dev_appserver.py DIR`, and ensure it's running by visiting your local server's address (by default [localhost:8080][5].)
1. (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with [the endpoints tool][6].
1. Deploy your application.

## Tasks

## Task 1: Add Sessions to a Conference

### Define the following Endpoints methods

- `getConferenceSessions(websafeConferenceKey)`
   Given a conference, return all sessions

- `getConferenceSessionsByType(websafeConferenceKey, typeOfSession)`
   Given a conference, return all sessions of a specified type (eg lecture, keynote, workshop)

- `getSessionsBySpeaker(speaker)`
   Given a speaker, return all sessions given by this particular speaker, across all conferences

- `createSession(SessionForm, websafeConferenceKey)`
   Open only to the organizer of the conference

### Define Session class and SessionForm

In the SessionForm pass in:
- name
- highlights
- speaker
- duration
- typeOfSession
- date
- start time (in 24 hour notation so it can be ordered)

### Explain your design choices

The Sessions implementation is based heavy on the existing Conference
implementation due to their similar functionality and related purpose.

For the sake of simplicity speaker is defined as a StringProperty to avoid the
need create a separate speaker entity.

## Task 2: Add Sessions to User Wishlist

### Define the following Endpoints methods

- `addSessionToWishlist(SessionKey)`
   adds the session to the user's list of sessions they are interested in attending

- `getSessionsInWishlist()`
   query for all the sessions in a conference that the user is interested in

## Task 3: Work on indexes and queries

### Part 1: Come up with 2 additional queries

Think about other types of queries that would be useful for this application.
Describe the purpose of 2 new queries and write the code that would perform them.

Note: The following two endpoints can be assessed from the [API Explorer][7]

#### query 1

Get sessions by their duration.

```py
@endpoints.method(SESSION_GET_REQUEST_BY_DURATION, SessionForms,
            http_method='GET',
            name='getSessionsByDuration')
    def getSessionsByDuration(self, request):
        """Return sessions by their duration."""
        
        #converting string param (duration) to int
        sessions = Session.query(Session.duration == int(request.duration))

        return SessionForms(items=[self._copySessionToForm(session) for session in sessions])


```

#### query 2
Get all sessions for all conferences which are within a given location (city).

```py
@endpoints.method(SESSION_GET_REQUEST_BY_LOCATION,
                      SessionForms,
                      http_method='GET',
                      name='getSessionsByLocation')
    def getSessionsByLocation(self, request):
        """Return all conference sessions within a given city """
        confs = Conference.query(Conference.city==request.city)
        sessions = []
        for conf in confs:
            sessions += Session.query(ancestor=conf.key)

        return SessionForms(items=[self._copySessionToForm(session) for session in sessions])

```

### Part 2: Solve the following query related problem

> Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you don't like sessions after 7 pm.
> How would you handle a query for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm?

#### What is the problem for implementing this query?

An inequality filter can be applied to at most one property. The problem here
would require an inequality filter on two:

- typeOfSession not equal to workshop
- startTime less than 7 pm

#### What ways to solve it did you think of?

#### Solution:
An inequality filter can be applied to at most one property. This problem requires an inequality filter on two properties.

Assuming that we have a list of session types ( lets call it SessionTypes), we can combine the two inequalities to come up with a solution by first filtering out the type which is workshop('WORKSHOP' in this case) (this solution excludes sessions which begin before 7PM and run past it. That would require an extra condition):

```py
session_types = [type for type in SessionTypes if type != 'WORKSHOP']
time = datetime.strptime("19:00", "%H:%M").time()

sessions = Session.query(ndb.AND(Session.typeOfSession.IN(session_types), Session.startTime < time))

return sessions
```
## Task 4: Add a Task
When a new session is added to a conference, check the speaker. If there is more than one session by this speaker at this conference, also add a new Memcache entry that features the speaker and session names. You can choose the Memcache key.
The logic above should be handled using App Engine's Task Queue.

### Define the following Endpoints method

- `getFeaturedSpeaker()`
