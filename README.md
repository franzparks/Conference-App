Setup Instructions

Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
Update the values at the top of settings.py to reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the Developer Console.
Update the value of CLIENT_ID in static/js/app.js to the Web client ID
(Optional) Mark the configuration files as unchanged as follows: $ git update-index --assume-unchanged app.yaml settings.py static/js/app.js
Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's running by visiting your local server's address (by default localhost:8080.)
(Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
Deploy your application.
Tasks

Task 1: Add Sessions to a Conference

Define the following Endpoints methods

getConferenceSessions(websafeConferenceKey) Given a conference, return all sessions

getConferenceSessionsByType(websafeConferenceKey, typeOfSession) Given a conference, return all sessions of a specified type (eg lecture, keynote, workshop)

getSessionsBySpeaker(speaker) Given a speaker, return all sessions given by this particular speaker, across all conferences

createSession(SessionForm, websafeConferenceKey) Open only to the organizer of the conference

Define Session class and SessionForm

In the SessionForm pass in:

name
highlights
speaker
duration
typeOfSession
date
start time (in 24 hour notation so it can be ordered)
Explain your design choices

Functionality has been added for sessions which is in a similar fashion to the already implemented conferences
 functionality

For simplicity Speaker has been defined as a StringProperty of Session

Task 2: Add Sessions to User Wishlist

Define the following Endpoints methods

addSessionToWishlist(SessionKey) adds the session to the user's list of sessions they are interested in attending

getSessionsInWishlist() query for all the sessions in a conference that the user is interested in

Task 3: Work on indexes and queries

Part 1: Come up with 2 additional queries

Think about other types of queries that would be useful for this application. Describe the purpose of 2 new queries and write the code that would perform them.

Note: The following two endpoints can be assessed from the API Explorer

query 1

Get sessions by their duration.

@endpoints.method(SESSION_GET_REQUEST_BY_DURATION, SessionForms,
            http_method='GET',
            name='getSessionsByDuration')
    def getSessionsByDuration(self, request):
        """Return sessions by their duration."""
        
        #converting string param (duration) to int
        sessions = Session.query(Session.duration == int(request.duration))

        return SessionForms(items=[self._copySessionToForm(session) for session in sessions])



query 2

Get all sessions for all conferences which are within a given location (city)

@endpoints.method(SESSION_GET_REQUEST_BY_LOCATION,
                      SessionForms,
                      http_method='GET',
                      name='getSessionsByLocation')
    def getSessionsByLocation(self, request):
        """Return all conference sessions within a given city """

        confs = Conference.query(Conference.city==request.city)
        sessions = []
        for conf in confs:
            sessions += Session.query(ancestor=conf.key)

        return SessionForms(items=[self._copySessionToForm(session) for session in sessions])


Part 2: Solve the following query related problem

Letâ€™s say that you don't like workshops and you don't like sessions after 7 pm. How would you handle a query for all non-workshop sessions before 7 pm?
What is the problem for implementing this query?

An inequality filter can be applied to at most one property. This problem requires an inequality filter on two properties.

Assuming that we have a list of session types ( lets call it SessionTypes), we can combine the two inequalities to come up with a solution by first filtering out the type which is workshop('WORKSHOP' in this case) (this solution excludes sessions which begin before 7PM and run past it. That would require an extra condition):


session_types = [type for type in SessionTypes if type != 'WORKSHOP']
time = datetime.strptime("19:00", "%H:%M").time()

sessions = Session.query(ndb.AND(Session.typeOfSession.IN(session_types), Session.startTime < time))

return sessions

Task 4: Add a Task

Define the following Endpoints method

getFeaturedSpeaker() When a new session is added to a conference, check to see if there is more than one session by this speaker then add the sessions by this speaker and the speaker to memcache. Return the speaker and session names
